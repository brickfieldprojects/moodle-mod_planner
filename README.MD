## What is Planner? ##
Planner is a Moodle activity plugin which aims to support students in preparing for assessment. It is a time management and organisation tool. It should be of particular use to students who need additional and/or explicit guidance and support in this regard.

Planner works as follows:
- Setup:
  - Teacher defines a template of steps which students should complete in preparing for an assessment, including the percentage of time each step should take.
  - Teacher associates a Planner with either a Moodle Assignment or Quiz, which has start dates and end dates set.
  - Teacher calculates the steps for the students.
- Operation:
  - Planner works backwards from the assessment due date and calculates the dates by which students should aim to complete each of the steps.
  - Planner populates these steps in students' Moodle calendars.
- Student use:
  - Students access Planner for information and guidance on each step, and can self-check when they have completed a step.
  - Students receive automatic email reminders if they miss a step.
  - Students can recalculate the steps for themselves if they know they will start preparing their assessment later than the defined start date.
- Reporting:
  - Teachers can access a report of students who have self-checked their step completion.
